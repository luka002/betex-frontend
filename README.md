# What is BETex?

BETex is an application that provides predictions for football games. This repository contains frontend code. Backend code is not publicly accessible but I can give permission upon request.

The application has free predictions that are available to all users and premium predictions. Users have option to buy 1 month access to premium section where premium predictions can be seen. Premium predictions can also be sold in form of a tickets. Admin can create tickets where each ticket contains at least 1 premium prediction and then they can be bought by users.

Users have to register to be able to buy premium predictions. Registration can be executed trough a form or with social authentication(Google and Facebook).

Admins can add and edit predictions and users.
