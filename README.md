# What is BETex?

BETex is an application that provides predictions for football games. This repository contains frontend code. Backend code is not publicly accessible but I can give permission upon request.

The application has free predictions that are available to all users and premium predictions that are available upon purchase. Users have the option to buy 1 month access to premium section. Premium predictions can also be sold in the form of a ticket. Admin can create tickets where each ticket contains at least 1 premium prediction. Users have to register to be able to buy premium predictions. Registration can be executed trough a form or with social authentication (Google and Facebook).

Along ticket creation, administrators can add and edit predictions and users. Also, they can generate images that are composed from prediction. Those images are meant to be published on Instagram.
